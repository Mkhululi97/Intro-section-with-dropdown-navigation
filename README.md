## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that rushing out to type code doesn't always meaning
that you are making progress with the project.
Slowly things down and unpacking the challenge is very helpful
because this provides clarity and when I get stuck
I am able to figure out why I am not seeing the changes I'm making
on the CSS file, not being reflected on the layout or style of the
webpage. Sometimes when the change is not reflected on the layout, it's because I have made a typo on the class I want to apply certain styling on, when I'm quick to type on the keyboard, I may pickup this typo after some 30mins trying figure what the problem is, but when I'm working slowly, it takes less longer to spot the typo.

### Continued development

I want to improve the way I build layouts, breaking each section
down and structure the HTML container divs accordingly and to also look at the bigger picture to spot components/sections that might look similar, so that I can reuse code and apply the DRY principle.
I want to improve the way name my classes, because I have
longer class name and that is not ideal.
